Step 1 :

**

download redis from :

https://github.com/MicrosoftArchive/redis/releases


Step 2 :

**

Now open C:\Program Files\Redis\redis-cli.exe file


Step 3 :

**

check installation is ok or not ?

127.0.0.1:6379>ping ok



Step 4 :

**

insert database by :

set name arman


Step 5 :

**

view database by :

get name


Step 6 :

**



download redis in project directory :

C:\xampp\project > composer require predis/predis




<?php 

	// link redis files
	
	require('vendor/autoload.php');


	// database connection

	$redis = new Predis\Client(); 
	$redis->connect('127.0.0.1', 6379); 
    


	// insert query 

	if(isset($_POST['submit'])){

		$id = $_POST['id'];

		$name = $_POST['name'];


	    $insert = $redis->set($id,json_encode(

						array(
							"name" => "$name"
						)
									   
					));

	    if($insert){
	    	echo "inserted";
	    }

	}




   // view

   if(isset($_POST['view'])){

   		$id = $_POST['id'];

   		// bring expected data

   		$response = $redis->get($id);

   		// json decode after bring data

   		$response = json_decode($response);

   		echo $response->name;
 
   }




   // delete

   if(isset($_POST['delete'])){

   		$id = $_POST['id'];

   		// bring expected data

   		$delete = $redis->DEL($id);

   		 if($delete){
	    	echo "delete";
	    }
	 
 
   }
?>

Benifits :

1. NoSQL databases were created in response to the limitations of traditional relational database technology

2. able to handle Large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data

3. Object-oriented programming that is easy to use and flexible

4. Non-relational and schema-less data model

5. Low latency and high performance

6. Highly scalable




NoSQL Database Types :

1. Document databases pair each key with a complex data structure known as a document. 
   Documents can contain many different key-value pairs, or key-array pairs, or even nested documents
   
2. Graph stores are used to store information about networks of data, such as social connections. 
	Graph stores include Neo4J and Giraph.
	
3. Key-value stores are the simplest NoSQL databases. Every single item in the database is stored as an 
	attribute name (or 'key'), together with its value
	

	
	
Redis :

1. Redis, REmote DIctionary Server

2. keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.

3. Redis allows a user to set an expiration time for key-value pairs and requires all stored data to fit into a server RAM

4. Data storage in RAM allows very fast read/write operations. Furthermore, data is persisted to a disk and in the case of a 
   server restart can be restored back to RAM for quick access
   
5. 1 Million Keys â€“ String Value pairs use 100MB of memory




MongoDB :

1. MongoDB is document storage designed for high performance, high availability, and with automatic scaling

2. Documents are saved in a BSON format (binary JSON)



Big Data :

Big data is a blanket term for the non-traditional strategies and technologies needed to gather, organize, process, and gather insights from large datasets.

The general categories of activities involved with big data processing are:

Ingesting data into the system
Persisting the data in storage
Computing and Analyzing data
Visualizing the results
